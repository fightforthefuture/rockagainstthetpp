  <p>
    Congress is about to decide the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
    (TPP), an anti-democratic deal between 12 countries that was negotiated in
    complete secrecy by government officials and hundreds of corporate
    lobbyists. If it becomes law, the TPP would be the largest deal of its kind
    in history, and it poses a grave threat to

  </p>

  <h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do about it?</h2>
  <p>
    The TPP text has already been finalized, but before it becomes law, U.S.
    Congress must approve it. With all the
    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/may/08/trans-pacific-partnership-obama-irony">extreme
      secrecy</a> and blatant

    surrounding this deal, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why voters from across the
    political spectrum overwhelmingly oppose it. Even all the leading
    presidential candidates are
    <a href="https://www.citizen.org/documents/presidential-candidates-TPP.pdf">against
      it!</a> But pro-TPP members of Congress are
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/business/trans-pacific-partnership-supporters-pin-hopes-on-lame-duck-vote.html?_r=0">still
      plotting</a> to rush the TPP to a vote this Fall. They want to do it
    quietly. <strong>That&rsquo;s why we need to get loud.</strong>

    What is Rock Against the TPP?
  </h3>

  <p>
    Rock Against the TPP is a massive effort to sound the alarm about the toxic
    backroom deal that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Through a series of
    large-scale educational concert events, protests, teach-ins, and trainings,
    we&rsquo;ll reach thousands of people who haven&rsquo;t heard about the TPP
    yet, and ignite a movement to stop it in its tracks. The tour is a
    partnership between viral internet freedom nonprofit
    <a href="https://fightforthefuture.org/">Fight for the Future</a> and
    <a href="http://firebrandrecords.com/">Firebrand Records</a>, the new
    freedom fighting record label co-founded by Ryan Harvey and Tom Morello.
